/* 
Notes:
Order of importing:
The order of importing the components, affects the final style of the items.
The order must be from broad to specific, thats why we import in this order:
1. Base
2. Template
3. Modules
4. Components

Class naming:
1. Classes related to a React component are written in uppercase withouth spaces. Example: CardGrid.
2. Classes not related to React are written in lower case with dashes. Example: video-container
